"At the heart of every progressive webapp is a responsive site"

###Our Site Content
Content is king! Content must work across a wide selection of devices.

Site Stats
  - ~54% Desktop
  - ~41% Mobile
  - ~5% Tablet
  
Your stakeholders need to be involved in the process.

###Prioritise Content
Content does not have to be in the same order on every device. Tailor content to the needs of the device. For a restaurant you maybe want to prioritise booking over photos of the restaurant.

###Ensure Content is Discoverable
Navigating websites is easy on large screens, on small screens these are hidden inside of "burger" menus. Dont hide content on small screen devices. If you visit from Google and the information is not visible, it leads to poor UX.

Invite users in to test your sites. Go out into the street and ask to test your site. A-B test functionality.

###Site Performance
  - render performance
  - page load performance
  - perceived performance
  
Images make up the whopping majority of page weights. Create a performance budget.

Use picture element to manage responsive images. Rely on *picturefill*. Defer the loading of both image and videos. Not all content is created equally.
